This project is a full-stack weather prediction application designed with modern MLOps practices. It integrates tools such as DVC for version controlling datasets, MLFlow for managing and tracking models, and Airflow for workflow automation. The app is containerized using Docker and deployed on Kubernetes through an automated CI/CD pipeline, ensuring efficient and streamlined deployment.

The application includes a frontend interface where users can input weather features and receive temperature predictions. The backend, built with Flask or FastAPI, provides REST API endpoints for processing user inputs and serving predictions using a trained machine learning model. Additionally, the project incorporates a database to handle user authentication and session management securely.

To set up the project, clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the backend server locally. Docker can be used to containerize the application, while Kubernetes handles deployment for production environments. The CI/CD pipeline automates tasks like testing, Docker image creation, and Kubernetes deployment, ensuring a seamless workflow across development, testing, and production stages.

Key features include DVC for managing datasets and model artifacts, MLFlow for experiment tracking and versioning, and Airflow for automating data preprocessing and retraining pipelines. These tools provide robust version control, efficient workflows, and reproducibility for machine learning models.

This project highlights the practical implementation of MLOps principles, making it a valuable portfolio piece. With its modular design and automated workflows, it demonstrates how to effectively integrate machine learning with full-stack development and deployment.
